The App of Mapping was forged by learned hands deep in the scent-laden cavern of a humble Dungeon Master on a quest to automate dungeon and encounter creation with a magical tool for all comrade DMs. Many foes emerged while casting the App of Mapping, but in the end, good prevailed over evil to bring forth an app that randomly generates clean looking maps with a retro feel and detailed 5e-based encounters, all with the simple touch of a button. DMing will never be the same after the App of Mapping ushers in the bright dawn of a new era. Or actually DMing will likely stay the same, but just be easier with a handy app. Only the slow, noble churning of time within the multiverse will tell.

TL;DR: This app helps DMs create cool dungeons.
